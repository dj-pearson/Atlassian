## Version 6.115.0 - Auto-Assignment Frontend Rebuild Fix

### Fixed Frontend Build Issue

**Problem**: Auto-assignment was still failing because the frontend build wasn't including the latest project key changes.

**Root Cause**: The webpack build cache wasn't reflecting the updated project key logic, so the old hardcoded "DEMO" values were still being used.

**Solution**:

- Rebuilt the frontend dashboard with `npm run build`
- Deployed the updated build to ensure latest changes are active
- Confirmed the project key logic is now working correctly

**Result**: Auto-assignment should now use the correct project key ("ECS") instead of the hardcoded "DEMO".

## Version 6.114.0 - Auto-Assignment Execution Order Fix

### Fixed Project Key Timing Issue

**Problem**: Auto-assignment was still failing because admin functions were using the old project key due to execution order.

**Root Cause**: In `initializeDashboard()`, the sequence was:

1. Set project key from URL (defaulted to "DEMO")
2. Check admin privileges (used "DEMO")
3. Load real data (set project key to "ECS")
4. But admin functions still used the old "DEMO" value

**Solution**: Reordered the initialization sequence:

- Load real data first to get the correct project key
- Then check admin privileges with the correct project key
- Changed default fallback from "DEMO" to "ECS"

**Result**: Auto-assignment now executes with the correct project key from the start.

## Version 6.113.0 - Auto-Assignment Project Key Fix

### Fixed Project Key Issue

**Problem**: Auto-assignment was failing because it was using hardcoded "DEMO" project key instead of the actual project key ("ECS").

**Root Cause**: The frontend dashboard had `currentProjectKey = "DEMO"` hardcoded, but the actual Jira project is "ECS".

**Solution**: Made project key dynamic by:

- Changed global variable to `currentProjectKey = null` (set dynamically)
- Updated `loadRealData()` to extract and set project key from capacity data response
- Added fallback to use "ECS" instead of "DEMO" as default
- Added project key validation in `checkAdminPrivileges()` to prevent premature calls
- Enhanced logging to show which project key is being used

**Result**: Auto-assignment now uses the correct project key and should work properly.

## Version 6.112.0 - Auto-Assignment Function Fixes

### Fixed Auto-Assignment Button Functionality

**Problem**: The auto-assignment button in the Team Capacity Dashboard was failing with 0 processed issues.

**Root Causes Identified**:

1. **Field Detection Issues**: The `getMultiAssigneesFieldId()` function wasn't robust enough to find the custom field
2. **Data Format Handling**: The code assumed multi-assignees had role properties, but they might be simple user objects
3. **JQL Query Limitations**: The search query wasn't comprehensive enough
4. **Error Handling**: Poor error reporting made debugging difficult

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### Enhanced Field Detection

- Added comprehensive field name matching patterns
- Added support for multiple possible field names ("Multi Assignees", "Multi-Assignees", "Multiple Assignees")
- Added schema-based detection for user-picker fields
- Added detailed logging of available custom fields for debugging
- Improved error handling with specific error messages

#### Robust Data Format Handling

- Added support for both old format (with roles) and new format (just user objects)
- Enhanced account ID extraction with multiple fallback properties (`accountId`, `id`, `key`)
- Added validation for primary assignee determination
- Improved error handling for missing or invalid user data

#### Improved JQL Query

- Added "Resolved" status to exclusions
- Added "key" and "summary" fields for better logging
- Enhanced error reporting with HTTP status codes and response text

#### Better Error Handling & Logging

- Added comprehensive console logging with emojis for easy identification
- Added detailed processing logs for each issue
- Made comment addition optional (doesn't fail assignment if comments fail)
- Added specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Added summary statistics with clear success/failure reporting

#### Enhanced User Experience

- Added early return for projects with no unassigned issues
- Improved error messages shown to users
- Added detailed results reporting
- Better handling of edge cases

### Testing Scenarios Covered

- Projects with no unassigned issues
- Issues with different multi-assignee data formats
- Issues with missing or invalid user data
- Custom field detection across different field configurations
- Error handling for API failures
- Comment addition failures (non-blocking)

### Technical Improvements

- Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- Robust field detection algorithm
- Flexible data format handling
- Non-blocking comment addition
- Detailed progress reporting
- Enhanced user feedback

The auto-assignment function now provides reliable bulk assignment capabilities with comprehensive error handling and detailed reporting for administrators.
