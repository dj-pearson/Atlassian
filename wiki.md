4. **Workflow Respect**: Honors existing Jira workflow rules

### Sync Triggers

**Real-time Triggers:**

- Adding first multi-assignee to unassigned issue
- Changing order of multi-assignees
- Removing current primary assignee

**Manual Triggers:**

- Bulk auto-assignment from Admin Panel
- Manual assignment tool
- API-based assignments

### Sync Status Monitoring

**Success Indicators:**

```
‚úÖ Setting default assignee to first multi-assignee: [User Name]
‚úÖ Field update successful: 204
```

**Skip Indicators:**

```
‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping assignee update - already set to first multi-assignee: [User Name]
```

**Error Handling:**

- Detailed error logging
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Graceful fallback behavior
