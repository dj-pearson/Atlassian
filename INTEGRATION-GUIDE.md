## üîß Core Integrations

### Native Assignee Synchronization

- **Primary Assignee Sync**: The first user with "Primary" role automatically becomes the native Jira assignee
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes to multi-assignees instantly update the native assignee field

  {
    issue.multiAssignees.primary.displayName;
  }
}
{
  {
    issue.multiAssignees.secondary.size;
  }
}

  {
    issue.multiAssignees.reviewers;
  }
}
```

## üîê Permission System

### Role-Based Permissions

Each assignee role has specific permissions:

| Permission          | Primary | Secondary | Reviewer           | Collaborator |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| Edit Issue          | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ        | ‚ùå                 | ‚ùå           |
| Transition Status   | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ (approval only) | ‚ùå           |
| Log Time            | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ        | ‚ùå                 | ‚ùå           |
| Assign Others       | ‚úÖ      | ‚ùå        | ‚ùå                 | ‚ùå           |
| View Sensitive Data | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ                 | ‚ùå           |

## üîç JQL Extensions

### Custom JQL Functions

The app extends JQL with multi-assignee specific functions:

```sql
-- Workload-based queries
workloadBalanced(project, maxLoad)
assigneeCapacity(user, threshold)
teamUtilization(project, percentage)

-- Role-based queries
hasRole(user, role)
roleCount(role, operator, value)
collaborationScore(project, threshold)

-- Time-based queries
assignedSince(date)
roleChangedAfter(date)
approvalPending(timeout)
```

### Query Examples

```sql
-- Find overloaded team members
assigneeCapacity(currentUser(), "> 80%")

-- Issues needing review approval
approvalPending("2d") AND reviewers is not EMPTY

-- Balanced team assignments
workloadBalanced("PROJ", 8) ORDER BY priority DESC

-- Collaboration analysis
collaborationScore("PROJ", "> 7") AND assigneeCount > 2
```
